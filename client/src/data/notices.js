College/University will be delivering all formal written examinations remotely or where it is not possible to deliver exams remotely they will be rescheduled. Online teaching methods can be accessed through www.uem.edu.in / www.iemcrp.com / www.iemlearning.com",
	"Hostels will remain open and operative. We advise students and their guardians not to encourage movement of the students out of hostels or travelling by train or by air. The foreign students are advised not to try to go to their home country as they may find acute problems in the airport, railway stations or at the border. In case they are quarantined, college/university authorities will be completely helpless in helping them out. Hence it is strongly advised that students should not move out.",
	"Also staying in hostels will help the students to access teaching resources, computing & lab resources, library, licensed software, high speed internet, etc.",
	"All teaching resources like computing & lab resources, library, licensed software, high speed internet, etc. will be available, but no mass gathering are encouraged.",
